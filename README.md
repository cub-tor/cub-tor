## Hi there üëã
I'm Elsa and I'm a junior developer. 

Here is a list of some projects that I made:

- [Eco-Friendly Vehicle Check](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/80640636525616/3853880937778113/7881917116438212/latest.html) : A Logistic Regression model is trained to predict the compliance of vehicle CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with European environmental regulations. The dataset used is ‚ÄòReal-world vehicle emissions‚Äô, created by Konrad Banachewicz and published on Kaggle. <br>
It was made using Databricks and PySpark.

 I would like to thank my friends [@sagilca](https://github.com/sagilca) and [@jordibc](https://github.com/jordibc) for their contributions. They helped me with the project theme and allowed me to use the questions and answers they created ‚ù§


- <ins>Quiz Cient√≠fico (second version)</ins> : The same quiz as before, but questions and answers are stored in a SQL database, as well as the player's name and punctuation. I used the firebase service of login, and JavaScript to make the app. The frontend is built with Vue.js and the backend, with Node.js. It works in localhost.<br>
