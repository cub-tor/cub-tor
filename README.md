## Hi there üëã
I'm Elsa and I'm a junior developer. 

Here is a list of some projects that I made:

- [Quiz Cient√≠fico (second version)](https://quiz-2023-385907.web.app/) : The same quiz as before, but questions and answers are stored in a SQL database, as well as the player's name and punctuation. I used the firebase service of login, and JavaScript to make the app. The frontend it's built with vue.js and the backend, with node.js
