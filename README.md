## Hi there üëã
I'm Elsa and I'm a junior developer. 

Here is a list of some projects that I made:

- [Eco-Friendly Vehicle Check](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/80640636525616/3853880937778113/7881917116438212/latest.html) : A Logistic Regression model is trained to predict the compliance of vehicle CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with European environmental regulations. The dataset used is ‚ÄòReal-world vehicle emissions‚Äô, created by Konrad Banachewicz and published on Kaggle. <br>
It was made using Databricks and PySpark.
